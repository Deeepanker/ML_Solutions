Questions from ML Class:

1.) How to minimize a generic polynomial equation? Taking the derivative and setting it to zero works for every kind of equation?

2.) Derivation of normal method of linear regression. For ex: (X'X)-1*X'*Y

3.) How/Why does vectorized implementation runs faster in computers? How do computers handle matrices?

4.) What is the principle of maximum likelihood? Essentially how does the equation for logistic regression comes into being?

5.) Think more deeply about the intuition of the regularization in linear and logistic regression. How do they help the algorithm?

6.) Think about how NNs are able to compute non-linear hypthoesis by building more complex features in hidden layers? Build a better intuition as to how do they do that?

7.)
